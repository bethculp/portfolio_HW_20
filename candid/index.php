                        <h2>Project Overview</h2>

                        <p>In February 2019, Foundation Center and GuideStar merged to become a new organization, Candid. With this merger came entirely new branding for the organization. With over 40 web properties between the two organizations, there was a mountain of rebranding work to be done. This presented an opportunity to streamline our design process among our internal 5-person design team. I was the project lead on developing our first Candid design system on Adobe XD. Based off of components and patterns from Google's Material-UI, we created a shareable design library used both by our internal design team and external consultants.</p>

                        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                        <p>This project presented huge learning opportunities for me. It was my first time creating and adapting components, a complete gamechanger for my user interface design processes. The design team was constantly in communication about our ongoing projects, and new challenges and branding guidelines were being established as we went. This UI library was being updated in real time as our branding evolved, which was a new challenge that enforced the importance of constant communication with the team through various iterations.</p>

                        <h2>Candid Style Guide</h2>
                        <p>Everything started with our Candid Style Guide. Developed by <a href="http://notclosed.com/" target="_blank">Open Design Studio</a>, with collaboration from the Candid in-house design team, the style guide outlined the branding guidelines for the logo, typography, photography, writing style, and more. While this guide served as our design bible as we undertook rebranding Candid's various properties, there were still many nuances and rules we had to decide for user interfaces. With continued converations with Open, the Candid design team started running with our new branding.</p>

                        <p>While our Candid style guide supplied our brand colors, we had to translate these into reusable and definable assets in the Adobe XD library. We also added specific UI colors not defined in the style guide, including grays and error colors.</p>

                        <p>Each component was based on the user interfaces and projects our team had worked on, combined with the Material-UI React framework. We created states for each component to better faciliate consistency between developers and designers. Having these reusable components available in a shared Adobe XD library greatly increased the efficiency and consistency of both the internal design team and our external consultants.</p>

                            <p>The Investing in Native Americans website was a massive project that I was truly honored to work on. From design ideation, client communication, to graphic design, to coding, this truly was an all-encompassing project for an important cause. I enjoyed learning about Native causes and working with my fellow team members to bring this goal to life in the form of this interactive web portal. I hope to work on similar projects in the future.</p>

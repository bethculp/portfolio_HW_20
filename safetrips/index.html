                        <h2>About this Project</h2>

                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <p>How might we give concerned travelers valid, current COVID-19 related safety information for transportation services so that we can minimize their fears of traveling during and after the pandemic?</p>
                
                        <h3>The Solution</h3>
                        <p>The SafeTrips mobile application empowers users to feel comfortable in their transportation choices by providing data-driven safety ratings of different travel services, based on both the service's safety protocols and real traveler experiences.</p>

                        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                        <p>I dove head first into the user research for this project, which was an exciting challenge. I wanted to create something that spoke to our unique time in history, when the entire world was living in new circumstances due to the pandemic. This made for interesting interviews and conversations about how to approach the research with my partner. I also was new to Figma, and this project deepened my knowledge of how the functionality overlaps and differs from XD.</p>

                        <p>An “I like, I wish, What if” brainstorm led me to generate a lot of features to address the problem statement. From there, I mapped out these ideas in a Feature Prioritization Matrix to find which features would be the most impactful, with the least amount of complexity. This would make an ideal Minimum Viable Product, with opportunities to expand into higher complexity items later.</p>

                        <p>Research had shown that users often looked at reviews during the traveling process. This indicated that the testimonials of others were an invaluable resource, and would add trust to the application.</p>

                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>The SafeTrips prototype demonstrates the value of crowd-sourced ratings and testimonials for travel safety. Data-driven ratings will help users feel that services have been looked at thoroughly, and that they are doing their due diligence when booking travel in a time of safety uncertainty.</p>

                                <li>Figure out how to start getting people to review their transportation services to build database of traveler reviews and statistics</li>
                                <li>Explore how the app could be adapted for other safety issues after the pandemic has become less of a travel risk</li>
